# AWS-Well-Architected-Best-Practices-Operational-Excellence
---
Operational excellence helps teams to focus more of their time on building new features that benefit customers, and less time on maintenance and firefighting. To build correctly, we look to best practices that result in well-running systems, a balanced workload for you and your team, and most importantly, a great customer experience.

## Objectives of the Project
In this project, we create AWS Resource Group consisting of two EC2 instances and use the "RUN Command" capability of AWS Systems Manager to install Amazon CloudWatch agent for collecting logs and getting some additional metrics.

By running this project, we will be able to:

* Add custom tags to EC2 instances
* Create an AWS Resource Group for specific Amazon EC2 instances
* Use AWS Systems Manager for configuration of Amazon EC2 instances
* Install and start Amazon CloudWatch agent with AWS Systems Manager
* Validate customs metric and log groups for Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon CloudWatch

## Evaluating the existing Architecture.
